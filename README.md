## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Aravind**, a hardware design engineer who enjoys building electronic systems and understanding how every layer â€” HW, SW, RTL, RF â€” fits together.

Iâ€™ve worked on **SoC/FPGA-based hardware**, designing and validating boards that handle high-speed interfaces, complex power delivery, and signal integrity challenges during my time in the industry.  
Outside of work, I spend my free time exploring personal projects â€” experimenting with circuits and ideas that help me grow as an engineer.

### ðŸ§° Tools & Skills
- **Design:** OrCAD, Allegro, Altium, KiCad  
- **Analysis:** HyperLynx, LTspice  
- **Programming:** Embedded C, Python, Verilog

### ðŸš€ Currently Exploring
- Building open hardware projects  
- Experimenting with ESP32-based control and monitoring systems  
- Learning RTL design to bridge system-level understanding

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To grow into a **System Design Engineer** who can architect, design, and validate complete hardware systems â€” not just individual layers.
